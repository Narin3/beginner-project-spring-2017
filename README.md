Spring 2017 Beginner's project
------------------------------

This is a spring beginners project for you young hackers to build up
and make your own.

Start this project just like any other `JavaScript` project with `npm
install`. Then run `npm run watch` to have your server, webpack
processes automatically watch for any kinds of changes.

Then open your browser to `localhost:8080` and make changes to the
`frontend/app.jsx` file, refresh the browser to see changes.
